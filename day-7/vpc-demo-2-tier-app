# VPC Demo for 2 tier app in private subnet

https://youtu.be/FZPTL_kNvXc

This example demonstrates how to create a VPC that we can use for servers in a production environment.

To improve resiliency, we deploy the servers in 2 Availability Zones, by using an Auto Scaling group and an Applicataion Load Balancer.
For additional security, we deploy the servers in private subnets. The servers receive requests through the load balancer. The servers can connect to the internet by using a NAT gateway.
To improve resiliency, we deploy the NAT gateway in both Availability Zones.

Overview:
The VPC has public subnets and private subnets in 2 Availability Zones.
Each public subnet contains a NAT gateway and a loadbalancer node.
The server run in private subnets, are launched and terminated by using an Auto Scaling group, and receive traffic from the load balancer.
The servers can connect to the internet by using the NAT gateway
